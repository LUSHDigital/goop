# GOOP - GOOgle Pub/sub
A Golang package for streamlining the usage of Google Cloud Pub/Sub.

The package that Google provide for Pub/Sub (cloud.google.com/go/pubsub) is awesome,
but it can be a little verbose in places. The purpose of this package is to make common Pub/Sub
tasks (creating topics, publishing and pulling messages) just a bit quicker and simpler.

## Installation
Install the package as normal:
```bash
$ go get -u github.com/LUSHDigital/goop
```
